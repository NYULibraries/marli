    The New York Public Library and the libraries of Columbia University and New York University have launched an initiative to expand access to collections and better serve their users.  The collaboration, dubbed the Manhattan Research Library Initiative (MaRLI), will enable NYU and Columbia doctoral students, full-time faculty and librarians, and vetted New York Public Library cardholders with a demonstrable research need not met by currently available resources, to borrow materials from all three institutions.  To apply for or renew borrowing privileges at New York Public Library and Columbia, please complete the information below.  Your application will be forwarded to both institutions and your credentials will be ready for pick up in two business days.  For further information about the initiative, including participating libraries, please see <a href= "http://library.nyu.edu/marli"> http://library.nyu.edu/marli</a> .
